# Outgoing Profanity Filter

A world of warcraft addon that can be used to filter out/ replace words in the users outgoing messages, to: bypass automated abuse bans, pretend to be friendly when insulting (word replacement), prevent manual abuse report scenarios, or to self mute entirely.

Instructions:
1. Install via Curseforge or pasting the source code to Addons folder.
2. Add a list of words to replace in "Words To Replace"
3. Configure a default replacement that will be used to replace all words in the "Words To Replace" list
4. (Optionally) Configure replacement overrides for particular words
5. Toggle whether you prefer partial or exact word matching algorithm to be in use (default/partial is the safest option but more intrusive)
6. Toggle self mute if preferred
7. For a list of example profanity to use with the addon, copy and paste the list at https://github.com/koda313/profanity-list/blob/main/words.txt

Commands:
1. /opf -> addon configuration
2. /opfsm -> toggle self-mute
